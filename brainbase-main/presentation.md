1. Project Overview
BrainBase - Student Manager is a web application designed to help educators or administrators manage student information efficiently. It allows users to add, view, and organize student data, including names, emails, and favorite subjects. The tool is built with modern web technologies to ensure a seamless user experience.

2. Use Cases: Plan vs. Implementation
Use Case	Planned	Implemented	Notes
Add new students	yes	yes	Form with name, email, and subject fields
View all students	yes	yes	List displays student details
Edit/Delete students (future)	yes	not yet	Planned for future updates
Search/filter students (future)	yes	not yet	Not implemented yet
3. Technical Implementation
Frontend: React with TailwindCSS

Backend: Firebase Firestore (for data storage)

State Management: Context API or local state

Testing: Manual testing for functionality

4. Key Features Demonstration
Add New Students – Form to input student details (name, email, favorite subject).

Display All Students – List of students with their information.

Persistent Storage – Student data saved and retrieved from Firebase.

Simple UI – Clean and intuitive interface for easy navigation.

5. Reflection & Learnings
What Worked:
Firebase integration simplified data storage.

TailwindCSS made styling straightforward.

Basic CRUD operations for students were successfully implemented.

What Didn’t:
Edit and delete functionality was not added due to time constraints.

No advanced filtering or search features yet.

Future Ideas:
Implement edit and delete functionality for student records.

Add search and filtering options.

Include student performance tracking or analytics.
